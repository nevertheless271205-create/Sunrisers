# Inventory Management System
Inventory Management System is a console-based Core Java project using OOP concepts. It allows users to add products, update stock, sell items, and view inventory. The system uses encapsulation, ArrayList, loops, and conditions, and includes a low-stock alert to manage inventory efficiently without databases or frameworks.
